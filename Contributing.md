# Contributing to Apex

Apex is free and open-source. Contributions are welcome to improve fidelity and usability.

## Guidelines
- **Focus**: Maintain deterministic, high-fidelity design. No interpolation/smoothing.
- **Priorities**:
  - Better mobile signal injection (if possible within API constraints).
  - Enhanced grid algorithms (e.g., hexagonal, radius-aware).
  - Result visualization helpers (optional export formats).
  - Validation scripts for real-device comparison.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Adhere to existing code style.
4. Test thoroughly—include red team validation if possible.
5. Submit pull request with clear description.

## Code of Conduct
- Respect ethical local SEO: No features that encourage spam or manipulation.
- Transparency: Document all changes impacting accuracy.

Thank you for helping raise the standard in local SEO tooling.
