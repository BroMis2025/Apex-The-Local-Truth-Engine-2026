## ⚠️ Read This Before Trusting Any Local SEO Report

If you are using **Any local keyword map grid tracking system**, your data contains **Simulation Bias**.

These tools are not broken.  
They are not misleading you intentionally.  

They are measuring a **different layer of Google** than where real mobile customers actually make decisions.

This repository documents the **Reality Gap** between:

- Simulated map visibility  
- Physical mobile SERP exposure  

…and provides the **free tools and evidence** to prove it yourself.

## 🧠 What This Repo Is (and Is Not)

**This repo is:**
- A forensic case study
- A technical reality check
- A measurement correction

**This repo is NOT:**
- A tool comparison rant
- An SEO “hack”
- A grid-tool takedown

The problem is not the tools.  
The problem is **what the industry assumes those tools represent**.

## 📄 Forensic Evidence: Grid Tools vs Physical Android Reality

I tested **50+ local keywords plus lat, long** across multiple verticals using:

- Industry-standard UULE grid tools  
- A **physical, rooted Android lab** passing **AAPI integrity**
- Live mobile SERP capture  
- No geocode snapping  
- No zoom bias  
- No viewport simulation  

### What the Grid Tools Reported
- Average rankings: **20+ (Red)**
- Poor “coverage”
- Apparent loss of visibility

### What Physical Android Devices Showed
- Consistent **Top 1–3 (Green)**
- Stable mobile Local Pack inclusion
- Real tap-to-call visibility

This is not theory.  
These are receipts.

## 🧪 Free Reality-Check Tools (Use at Your Own Risk)

This repository includes the **baseline tools** used to detect the Reality Gap.

### 🔧 Included Tools

- **Google_Apps_Script_Mobile_Proxy.js**  
  Query live **mobile SERPs** without UULE snapping, zoom bias, or desktop contamination.

- **Looker_Studio_Reality_Template**  
  Visualize what **real users actually see**, not simulated grid points.

These tools allow you to:
- Verify mobile exposure
- Catch false ranking losses
- Identify “map-only wins”
- Stop reporting on ghosts

### ⚠️ Important Limitation

These tools:
- Confirm the problem  
- Expose measurement failure  
- Reveal false wins  

They **do not**:
- Automate at scale  
- Handle bulk competitive mapping  
- Identify mobile-only dominance zones  
- Optimize for AI Answer Engines  
- Convert visibility into calls  

That gap is intentional.

## 🧨 The Local SEO Pun Nobody Noticed

You paid for **local MAP keyword tracking**.  
So you optimized **Maps**.

You won:
- Desktop visibility  
- Google Maps browse placement  
- Beautiful green grids  

Meanwhile, customers searched on:
- Mobile  
- Local 3-Pack  
- Tap-to-call results  

And nothing changed.

The win was real.  
It just didn’t do anything where money is made.
