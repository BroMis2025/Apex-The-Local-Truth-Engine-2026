# Interpreting Apex Results

Apex outputs raw, unsmoothed data. Interpretation requires understanding local search realities.

## Key Columns
- **Distance Miles**: From grid center—proximity is king.
- **Rank**: Exact position (1–20+). 
  - 1–3: Local Pack (high visibility/conversions).
  - 4–20: Finder depth (swipe/scroll required, lower impact).
  - 21/No Results: Invisible in pack.
- **Top Ranker**: Who dominates this point.

## What to Look For
- **Tight Bubble**: Strong near center, sharp drop-off → Classic proximity dominance.
- **Extended Coverage**: Top 3/10 across radius → Exceptional prominence/relevance (rare, optimized profiles).
- **Patchy Zones**: Sudden blanks → Possible category/relevance gaps, not tool error.
- **Gradient Trends**: Smooth fade (e.g., 1 → 5 → 12) → Healthy organic decay.

## Critical Insights
- Ranks >3 behave differently: Pack = exposure; Finder = low discoverability.
- No artificial smoothing: Ugly patterns are real—act only on confirmed issues.
- Validate anomalies with real device checks (e.g., DuoPlus cloud phones or rooted Android).

## Recommendations
- Cross-reference with Google Analytics/Search Console impressions/clicks.
- Focus optimization on prominence signals (reviews, citations) for broader coverage.
- Re-scan periodically—local is dynamic.

Apex shows truth. Use it to build sustainable strategies, not chase artifacts.
